# üö® Azure Web App Upload Issues - Solutions

## Why You Can't Find Upload Option

The upload option in Azure Web App depends on how the Web App was created:

### ‚ùå **Common Issues:**
1. **Web App created for GitHub integration** - No manual upload option
2. **Static Web App** instead of **App Service** - Different deployment methods
3. **Linux App Service** - May have different upload paths
4. **New Azure Portal UI** - Upload option moved/hidden

## ‚úÖ **Solution 1: Use Kudu (Always Works)**

This is the most reliable method for manual uploads:

### Steps:
1. **Go to your Web App in Azure Portal**
2. **Navigate to**: Development Tools ‚Üí **Advanced Tools**
3. **Click "Go"** (opens Kudu console in new tab)
4. **In Kudu**: Click **"Debug console"** ‚Üí **"CMD"**
5. **Navigate to**: `D:\home\site\wwwroot\` (or `/home/site/wwwroot/` on Linux)
6. **Delete existing files** if any (select all, right-click delete)
7. **Drag and drop your `dist.zip`** into the file area
8. **Right-click the zip file** ‚Üí **"Extract here"**
9. **Move contents** from extracted folder to root if needed
10. **Delete the zip file** after extraction

### Visual Guide:
```
Kudu Console ‚Üí CMD ‚Üí wwwroot folder ‚Üí Upload ‚Üí Extract ‚Üí Clean up
```

## ‚úÖ **Solution 2: GitHub Deployment (Recommended)**

Since manual upload is problematic, use GitHub integration:

### Quick Steps:
1. **Upload your project to GitHub** (use web interface if no Git)
2. **Create new Azure Web App** with GitHub integration
3. **Select your repository** during Web App creation
4. **Azure handles build and deployment automatically**

## ‚úÖ **Solution 3: FTP Upload**

### Steps:
1. **Get FTP credentials**: Web App ‚Üí Deployment Center ‚Üí FTPS credentials
2. **Use FTP client** (like FileZilla)
3. **Connect and upload** dist folder contents to `/site/wwwroot/`

## üéØ **Recommended Action Plan**

Given your upload issues, I recommend:

### **Option A: Try Kudu Method**
- Most reliable for one-time deployment
- Always available regardless of Web App configuration
- Direct file system access

### **Option B: Switch to GitHub Integration**
- More professional approach
- Automatic builds and deployments
- Better for ongoing development
- Easier to manage and troubleshoot

## üìù **Files You Need to Upload**

When uploading manually, upload contents of `dist/` folder:
```
index.html
assets/
web.config
```

**Don't upload**:
- Source code (src/, node_modules/, etc.)
- Development files
- The dist.zip itself (extract it first)

## üîß **If Kudu Doesn't Work**

Try these alternatives:
1. **Azure CLI**: `az webapp deployment source config-zip`
2. **Visual Studio Code**: Azure extension
3. **Azure DevOps**: Set up pipeline
4. **PowerShell**: `Publish-AzWebApp`

## üí° **Pro Tip**

For production applications, always use:
- GitHub Actions or Azure DevOps
- Automated CI/CD pipelines
- Infrastructure as Code (ARM templates/Bicep)

Manual uploads should only be for testing/development!
